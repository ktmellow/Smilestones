        bio: “As a single father, raising Sophie by myself, I needed all the help I could get. \
         My jobs don't pay well, so we live paycheck to paycheck. \
         I want to make sure that my daughter can afford the life I never had. \
         Every morning I drop a quarter into a piggy bank labelled Sophie's Educational Fund. \
         I want her to grow up to be a confident leader and passionate learner. So every moment I spend with her, I make it count. \
         I have always relied on my close friends and family for advice but sometimes even they didn't have all the answers. \
         After all, it takes a village to raise a child. And that's when I found Smilestones.”
