                 Many of these children will need early intervention in developing phoneme awareness skills to sufficiently \
                 develop their reading skills. Phonemic awareness is the ability to hear, identify, and manipulate \
                 individual sounds in spoken words. Before children learn to read print they must be aware of how \
                 the sounds in words work. A natural and spontaneous way of providing children with exposure to phonemes is to \
                 focus on literature that deals playfully with speech sounds through rhymes.",
